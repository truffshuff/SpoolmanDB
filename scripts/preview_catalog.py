"""Renders a markdown summary of the filament entries a PR would add.

It reuses the real expansion logic from compile_filaments, so the list shown to
the author is exactly what would end up in the database. Grouping the entries by
weight, spool type and diameter is deliberate: a combination the manufacturer
does not actually sell is obvious when it appears as its own heading.

It also flags filaments that look like ones already in the catalog. The build
already rejects two entries with the same generated id, but the id keeps
punctuation, so "PLA Basic - Black" and "PLA Basic Black" sail past it as two
distinct products.

Matching works on the source fields rather than the compiled name, comparing
the product line and the colour separately within one manufacturer, material
and weight. That separation matters: in a compiled name the product line
dominates the string, so "PolyLite PETG White" and "PolyLite PETG Lime" come
out 85% similar while being different products, and a typo in a colour on a
long product line is invisible. Held apart, each field is compared only on the
words that actually differ.
